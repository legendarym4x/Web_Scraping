## Web Scraping with Scrapy

In this work, we used the `Scrapy` framework. We scraped the site http://quotes.toscrape.com.

Our goal was to get two files: `quotes.json`, where all information about quotes from all pages of the site was placed,
and `authors.json`, where information about the authors of said quotes is located.

The structure of the json files is exactly the same as the file structure of the previous homework.

Executed previously written scripts to upload json files to `Mongodb` cloud database for received files.

The previous homework works correctly with the new database received.

The `crawler(spider)` is launched in the form of a single `main.py` script.
